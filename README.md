# README: Dragons R Us

This is a simple exercise in HTML and CSS designed for medium sized school groups.

## Brief

You've been hired by the CEO of Dragons R Us to design their new website! To save time, you've been provided with the basic HTML - but it looks awfully boring. Time for a makeover!

## How To

Open style.css in any text editor. By changing these "style rules", you can change how the web page looks to visitors - without needing to change the text.

## Ideas

* Make the headline a different colour, or bigger, or bold.
* Change the background colour.
* Make each section a different colour.
* Style the table. Give it coloured outlines and a shadow.
* Use the :hover attribute to make all sections change colour when you have the mouse over them.
* Use the :active attribute to make all dragons appear to be breathing fire when you click on them.
